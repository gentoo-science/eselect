A Brief Overview
================

Introduction
------------

eselect is a tool for administration and configuration on Gentoo systems. It
_will_ modify the system's behaviour and should be used with care by the system
administrator. eselect is a modular framework for writing configuration 
utilities. It consists of:

* A main program named ``eselect``.
* Various modules (``*.eselect`` files) which carry out different tasks.
* Several libraries which help ensure consistent behaviour and simplify the
  creation of new modules.

A module provides several actions. Actions typically either display some
information (``list`` and ``show`` actions are common) or update the system
somehow (for example, ``set`` and ``update``). Each module also provides
``help`` and ``usage`` actions which explains how to use the module.

Some modules install symlinks to the main program. eselect handles these
intelligently -- for example, it realises that ``profile-config list`` should be
treated as if the user had run ``eselect profile list``.

Advantages for End Users and System Administrators
--------------------------------------------------

For system administrators and end users, tools written as eselect modules offer
several advantages over the traditional 'write each tool from scratch' approach:

Consistent UI
  eselect modules provide a consistent user interface. Thanks
  to eselect's action framework, there is no longer any need to remember or
  look up dozens of ``-x`` style switches for each tool. The output format
  used by modules is also standardised.
Consistent Help format
  All eselect modules provide easily accessible help documentation via the
  ``help`` and ``usage`` actions.
Consistent tool naming
  There is no need to remember dozens of ``foo-config`` and ``update-blah`` 
  names. To see a list of available tools, simply run ``eselect`` with no 
  arguments. Of course the foo-config style are still available (via symlinks) 
  if you prefer them.
Guaranteed Support for ``$ROOT``
  For those of you using $ROOT, you will not have to worry about whether a 
  particular tool can handle it. Support for ``$ROOT`` is required for all 
  eselect modules.

Advantages for Developers and Package Maintainers
-------------------------------------------------

Writing your tool as an eselect module rather than starting from scratch gives
you various benefits:

Faster Development time
  Much of the work has already been done for you. eselect provides a series 
  of libraries for common tasks, and the main ``eselect`` program handles 
  most of the hard work for you. All you need to do is provide the actions and 
  any domain specific functions you require.
Automatic Actions
  The ``help`` and ``usage`` actions are automatically generated from your 
  actions, so there is no need to spend time worrying about keeping these 
  written up to date.
Easy, Consistent Behaviour
  Because most of the input, output and command line handling is split off 
  into library functions, writing a 'standard' module which behaves 
  consistently with other tools is very simple.
Familiar Format
  For Gentoo developers, the eselect module format will be very familiar -- it 
  is a ``bash`` file with a structure that is quite similar to ebuilds.

Using eselect
=============

Usage
-----

eselect should be called as shown below: ::

	eselect [<global-options>] <module> <action> <options>

eselect features consistently named actions among most of its modules. There 
is only one global option as of now; --no-color, which asks eselect to stop 
showing colored output. The following are standard action names -- each module 
may provide a subset of these actions:

help
  Print the modules help screen.
usage
  Print information on how to invoke the modules actions.
version
  Print the modules version and other useful information.
list
  Prints a set of selectable options.
show
  Prints the currently active configuration(s).
set
  Select one of the options offered by ``list``.
enable
  Enable one of the module specific features.
disable
  Disable one of the module specific features.
update
  Like ``set``, but automatically selects an option rather than taking a 
  parameter.
scan
  Gather information about the system and store it for future usage by the 
  module.

A typical session will look like the following for most modules: ::

    # eselect <module> list
    These selections are available:
      [1] <first>
      [2] <second>
  
    # eselect <module> set <first>
    # eselect <module> show
    Active selection:
      <item1>

You can usually set items either by name or by number.

.. vim: set ft=glep tw=80 sw=4 et spell spelllang=en : ..
