1.0_rc1:
    Bug fixes:
    - Added missing description of --global flag in the bashcomp module's
      manual page (bug #101898).
    - kernel module's 'list' action now only lists kernels and not everything
      in /usr/src (bug #104354).
    - Fixed unexpected EOF error when calling the rc module's 'restart'
      action (bug #106540).
    - Fixed a 'file not found' bug in the rc module when encountering bogus
      baselayouts (thanks to Mike Doty <kingtaco@gentoo.org>).
    - Fixed bug in usage of has() library function in main eselect script
      (thanks to Sven Wegener <swegener@gentoo.org>).
    - Fixed unportable uses of absolute paths to binaries.
    - Exit with an error if the user doesn't provide parameters to the various
      rc module actions (start, stop, restart, etc).
    - Our autogen script now works on non-linux boxes.
    - Added symlinks for the manual pages of the modules we already provide
      symlinks for.
    - Added missing manual page for kernel module.

    New features:
     - inherit() support that allows dynamic and individual sourcing of
       libraries for each module.
     - Added support for modules to be able to describe the options/parameters
       they accept via describe_ACTION_options() and
       describe_ACTION_parameters().  These descriptions now show up in the
       help/usage output for the respective module.
     - profile module's 'set' action now accepts a --force flag for forcing the
       setting of a profile.
     - smart line wrapping for lines longer than the current terminal width.

    functions.

    - Added env module to replace env-update.
    - Added dirname()/basename() function in pure bash to reduce number of
      calls to external binaries.

0.9.5:
    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed nocolour handling that caused literal interpretation of '*' thus
      causing the contents of ${PWD} to be displayed instead.
    - Now recognizes the us'ian --no-color in addition to --no-colour.
    - Reverted the colours implementation to the previously used one as all
      the 'colours' calls in a sub-shell made displaying things quite slow.
    - Removed hardcoded paths to binaries that were present in certain modules.
    - Added GNU sed checks so we use the proper path thus allowing it to work
      on systems whose GNU sed is 'gsed'.
    - bashcomp module now properly supports using corresponding numbers
      (from list action) when running enable/disable action.
    - eselect bash-completion now recognizes (and completes on) global options.

    - implemented global options handling generally and a --no-colour
    option specifically.
    - all modules mark currently active options with a * in list subaction.

0.9.3:
    Bug Fixes:
    - mailer and kernel modules: handle no targets better, show current
    selection when doing a list.
    - usage message should now always be correct.
    - support for many more symlink prefixes and suffixes.

    - profile module now works with current profiles.desc format.
    - mailer module now works (previously broken due to typo and
      missing test in find_targets glob loop).
    - bashcomp module's show sub-command no longer returns 1.
