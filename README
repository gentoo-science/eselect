Style Notes
-----------

* Always use ``[[ brackets ]]``, never `[ brackets ]`.
* Use quotes on variables where necessary.
* For all source files, the same indenting rules apply as for ebuilds:
  one tab per indent level, with each tab representing 4 places.
* Avoid lines wider than 79 positions.
* Public functions don't get the ``es_`` prefix, private functions do.
* eval is evil, so don't use it.
* Absolute paths to executables are not portable, so don't use them.
